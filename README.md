Consider a Consider a 3Ã—3 process given by Orgunnaike and Ray (1979); the transfer function matrix is obtained by empirical modeling technique as:

Try to design following controllers using ETF based methods

<ol>

 <li>Decentralized control</li>

 <li>Spases control</li>

 <li>Decoupling control</li>

</ol>

Compare the performance with the control system based on classical decentralized BLT control method by simulating the closed-loop performances for step response R<sub>1</sub>(t)=1 for t&gt;0, R<sub>2</sub>(t)=1 for t&gt;50 and R<sub>3</sub>(t)=1 for t&gt;100, respectively. (try to adjusting the the simulation time frame if the simulation horizens are not suitable).
